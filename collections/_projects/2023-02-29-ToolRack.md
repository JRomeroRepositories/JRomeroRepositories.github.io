# Power Tool Rack
### Introduction
I took on this project because I found my small apartment workshop could use area for my power tools, since the bag I kept them in was getting in the way. The tools are used too often to be placed into deeper storage. I thought a simple board and some 3D printed holder should make quick work of my objective.

### Objective
The objective of this project was fairly straightforward - neatly mount all 5 of my Ryobi brand power tools on the wall.

### Set up
- Setting up this project is fairly straightforward - 5 tools to be mounted + the battery charger. 
- The CAD designs necessary are reduced from 5 to 3 distinct designs because 3 of the four tools can be mounted using the same mount type.
- Once the designs are complete, they can be printed individually using black PLA on my Ender 3 V3 SE FDM 3D printer.
- Tool types
    1. Saw
    2. Hand Vaccuum
    3. Orbital Sander
    4. Portable Flash Light
    5. Power Drill

Next step was to design the CAD files. Since I'm using a popular tool brand, I was able to find existing designs for the battery connector section, which is common to all Ryobi One-plus series tools. Thus, I only had to frame this design correctly so that it cold be attached to the wall correctly.

### Assembly
Printing the tools was relatively straight forward, I used cubic infill on all of the parts, 7% on all but the hand-vac mount, on which I used 15% in case the front of the vac gets bumped from the front where the torque on the battery connector would be significant.

To assemble the tool rack, I used a 2" x 8" board that I had left over from a previous project. It was about 4 feet which was nearly perfect for the small area above the storage bin array. The pine wood was especially soft which made it easy to mount to the studs and conveniently use wood screws to mount fix each of the mounts to the board.

### Final thoughts
The project was relatively simple but still rewarding and physically engaging. The perfect palette clenser project to distract me when I needed a break from another project.
