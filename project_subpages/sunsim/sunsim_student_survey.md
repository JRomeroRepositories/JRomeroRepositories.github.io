#### SunSim UW Student Survey
UW SunSim Survey aims to validate the Canadian university students as an early adopter segment for technical solutions addressing winter fatigue. The survey seeks to understand the prevalence and impact of winter fatigue among university students, their awareness and engagement with solutions, and their openness to adopting technological aids for enhancing light hygiene.

*Overview of the survey's purpose*

- *To quantify how many students experience winter fatigue (A phenomenon characterized by low mood, lack of energy, and reduced productivity during the winter months)*
- *To understand the extent to which winter fatigue affects students' daily activities and academic performance.*
- *To determine students' awareness of the causes of winter fatigue, particularly the role of light, and their interest in seeking solutions.*
- *To gauge interest in a mobile app designed to improve and maintain good light hygiene, potentially offering a novel solution to winter fatigue.*

Please be aware that the anonymity of all survey participants will be strictly preserved, with no linkage between their responses and their identities.

Optionally, participants may choose to provide their first name and email contact information via a separate form to enter a random draw for an incentive prize. This contact information will not be associated with their survey responses in any manner. The randomly selected student will be emailed a prize when the survey is complete.
