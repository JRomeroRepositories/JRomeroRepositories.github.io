Howdy, I'm J. Romero. I'm passionate about solving problems by implementing great ideas and technologies, in a way that's both creative and practical. 
I also have a passion for people, and how effective teams become more than the sum of their parts. 

While you're here, explore my past and current projects to see what I've been working on; or take stroll through my history to see how I got here and where I'm headed.

If you would like to connect with me about anything at all, please use the links below to reach me.
