Howdy! I'm J. Romero. 
<br><br>
I'm keen on solving real problems by implementing great ideas and technologies in a creative and practical way.
I also have a passion for people, and how effective teams become more than the sum of their parts. 
<br><br>
While you're here, explore my past and current projects to see what I've been working on; or take stroll through my history to see how I got here and where I'm headed.
